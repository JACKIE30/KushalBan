It details 'Forest rights' for 'LAND and OCCUPATION Bighas', indicating these rights are 'heritable' but 'not transferable'. It lists 'Title Holder(s)' and their dependents, explicitly identifying them as 'Traditional Forest Dweller'. Key administrative bodies like 'Panchayat' and 'Gram Sabha' are mentioned, which are central to the implementation of the Forest Rights Act (FRA). The format includes specific fields for land parcels (Khasra No.), geographical locations (Dalhousie, Chamba, Himachal Pradesh), and applicant details, characteristic of a form or record used in the process of recognizing Individual Forest Rights (IFR) under the FRA.",
